FastDF: Integrate neutrino geodesics in linear theory
=====================================================

Author: Willem Elbers

Requires as input a data cube containing the primordial phases (e.g. the matter density field divided by the transfer function, which can be generated with Mitos) and a perturbation vector from CLASS (which can be exported with classex). The code derives its name from the \delta f method (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07321), which it uses to greatly reduce shot noise from thermal motion.
