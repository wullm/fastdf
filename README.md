FastDF: Integrate geodesics in linear theory
============================================

Author: Willem Elbers

Requires as input a data cube containing the primordial phases (the matter density field divided by the transfer function) and a perturbation vector from CLASS (which can be exported with [classex](https://github.com/wullm/classex)). The code derives its name from the [\delta f method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07321), which it uses to greatly reduce shot noise from thermal motion.
